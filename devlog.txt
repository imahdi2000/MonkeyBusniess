OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Learned how to use PVectors

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- We planned on using x,y coordinates for all the Objects (ex: Player, Bullets, etc).
However, we realized it makes more sense to use PVectors than only x,y coordinates because vectors already have
x,y components and have additional methods to easily calculate the magnitude of the vector.
- We decided to only check for the closest enemy when a turret is finding an enemy to target instead of storing enemies in range of the turret in a priority queue because a priority queue is unecessary
